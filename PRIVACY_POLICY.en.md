## Presentation

Warning Goose is an alert tool that allows us to report uses of our personal
data that we find questionable with regard to the free or paid services and
products that we can obtain from the organizations that offer them to us. 

Warning Goose also allows you to signal your intention to participate in
collective complaints.

Warning Goose is part of a process of collecting information that covers :

* Our reports on organisations whose compliance with the RGPD is in doubt.
* Our intentions to complain against these organizations according to our
  rights acquired through the DPMR


Warning Goose processes this information:

* To make them visible on the Warning Goose website to everyone and anonymously
  for both the alerts and the organization.
* To transmit them to the collective complaints groups or class actions that
  can act against organizations in your territory.


Warning Goose has the following objectives:

* To enable us to exercise our rights under the General Data Protection Regulation
  Regulation or GDPR.
* To facilitate the organisation and logistics of collectives bringing
  collective complaints in Europe and around the world.


Warning Goose allows :

* To make anonymous reports and to do so only keeps the email address which
  only allows us to verify that we are not robots.
* To report our intention to complain and to do so, we transfer the email
  address to the collective and keep it for 1 year before deletion and can
  delete it at any time at your request.
* To receive news from Warning Goose and in this case we keep the email address
  until you request deletion.


Warning Goose only collects reports concerning the use of your personal data by
legal entities, any other form of report will not be processed and will be
deleted as soon as the teams at Warning Goose become aware of it.

* To know your rights concerning the protection of your data
* To understand how the collective complaint works and the procedures to be
  followed by collectives
